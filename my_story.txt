My Story
By: Aaron and the Students of 98-174 F17

Chapter 1
---------
Once upon a time, a squirrel named Nibbles lived alone in a vast forest.
Every day, Nibbles would leave the safety of his home in the big oak tree
to search for acorns to save up for the long, cold winter.
One brisk October day, Nibbles was returning home with his cheeks full of
acorns. As he peeped into the entrance to his burrow, he gasped in surprise
at what he saw.

Chapter 2
---------
All of the acorns he had been collecting for months had been stolen!
His Ikea cupboards were empty and bare. The thieves even took his secret stash of
candided acorn cheesecake!
Nibbles spent the next month working each day well into the night to
replenish his food reserves. Even so, he spent the winter cold, hungry, and lonely.

The End
